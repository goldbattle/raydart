# Raydart

Raydart aims to be a standalone streaming platform. It should allow anybody to host their own streaming website and rtmp distribution from their own computer. Additionally, it aims to have an authentication system to allow for different streamers to stream on the same website, while also limiting access to people that can view such content. See each subfolder for both the frontend (client website) and the backend (rtmp distribution server) information.


## TODOs

* Added authentication
* Redo the frontend layout
* Add stream transcoding
* Nice admin and stats page
